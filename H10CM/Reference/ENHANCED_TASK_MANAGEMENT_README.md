# Task Management System üöÄ

**Status: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - July 12, 2025**

## Overview
The Task Management System provides a complete workflow for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks within the H10CM Project Management Dashboard. It features smart notifications, user task management, and seamless integration with the project management workflow.

## ‚ú® Implemented Features

### üìã Complete Task Lifecycle
- **Task Creation & Assignment** - Create tasks with priority levels and assign to team members
- **Due Date Management** - Set and track task due dates with overdue detection
- **Status Tracking** - 5-status system: Pending, In Progress, Completed, On Hold, Overdue
- **Priority Levels** - Low, Medium, High, Critical with visual indicators

### ÔøΩ Smart Notifications
- **Assignment Notifications** - Automatic notifications when tasks are assigned
- **Status Change Alerts** - Updates when task status changes
- **Priority-Based Styling** - Notifications styled based on task priority
- **Actionable Links** - Click to navigate directly to "My Tasks" page

### ÔøΩ My Tasks Interface
- **Personal Task Dashboard** - Dedicated `/my-tasks` page for each user
- **5-Tab Filtering System**:
  - Pending (not started)
  - In Progress (actively worked on)
  - Completed (finished tasks)
  - On Hold (paused/blocked)
  - Overdue (past due date)
- **Real-time Statistics** - Task counts and progress indicators
- **Quick Status Updates** - One-click status changes with confirmation dialogs

### üéõÔ∏è Project Integration
- **Seamless Creation** - Create tasks directly from project management dashboard
- **Tab-Based Organization** - Clean project separation (Active/Planning, Completed, Inactive/Archived)
- **User Assignment** - Select team members from available users

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- Active Projects from Project Management System
- Production Unit Step Status from Batch Tracking
- Team Member Availability from User Management
- Project Deadlines from Project Configuration

### Task Generation Algorithm
```typescript
// Example: Stalled Unit Detection
const stalledUnits = trackedItems.filter(unit => {
  const inProgressSteps = unit.step_statuses.filter(s => s.status === 'In Progress');
  return inProgressSteps.some(step => {
    const daysSinceUpdate = calculateDaysSince(step.completion_timestamp);
    return daysSinceUpdate > 3; // Configurable threshold
  });
});
```

### Priority Calculation
- **Base Score**: Task category importance (Production: 40, Quality: 50, Planning: 30)
- **Urgency Multiplier**: Based on deadline proximity and unit count
- **Impact Factor**: Business impact assessment (1.5x for critical path items)

## üìã Task Categories

### Production Tasks
- Batch processing opportunities
- Equipment setup requirements
- Production line configuration

### Quality Control Tasks
- QC backlog reviews
- Quality checkpoint validations
- Process improvement assessments

### Planning Tasks
- Deadline risk assessments
- Resource allocation reviews
- Workflow optimization

### Inventory Tasks
- Stock level verifications
- Material requirement planning
- Procurement coordination

## üöÄ Benefits

### For Production Managers
- **Proactive Problem Detection**: Catch issues before they impact deadlines
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient task distribution across team
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Actionable insights from production data

### For Team Members
- **Clear Priorities**: Smart task prioritization eliminates guesswork
- **Balanced Workloads**: Even distribution prevents burnout
- **Context-Rich Tasks**: Each task includes project context and rationale

### For Operations
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduced manual task management overhead
- **Better Visibility**: Real-time insight into production bottlenecks
- **Predictive Management**: Proactive rather than reactive task assignment

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Project Management Dashboard
- Seamlessly integrated into existing PM dashboard
- Uses existing project and user data
- Maintains consistent UI/UX patterns

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Respects existing role permissions
- Admin and ProjectManager access to full features
- Team member access to assigned tasks

### Notification System
- Integration with existing smart notification service
- Real-time alerts for high-priority tasks
- Email/dashboard notifications for deadline risks

## üìä Metrics & Analytics

### Task Performance Metrics
- Task completion rates by category
- Average time to completion
- Team productivity scores
- Bottleneck resolution effectiveness

### Production Impact Metrics
- Reduction in stalled units
- Improved on-time delivery rates
- Quality control efficiency gains
- Resource utilization improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Threshold Settings
- Stalled unit detection threshold (default: 3 days)
- Batch processing minimum units (default: 3 units)
- Deadline risk assessment period (default: 7 days)
- Quality control escalation time (configurable)

### Team Settings
- Skill-based task matching
- Workload balancing preferences
- Availability status management
- Overtime alert thresholds

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Predictive task generation based on historical patterns
- **Mobile Application**: Task management on mobile devices
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed performance dashboards and reports
- **Integration APIs**: External system integration capabilities

### Workflow Improvements
