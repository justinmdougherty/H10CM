Listed below are the steps I’d like to capture in a “traveler” format.

•	PCB mods performed
•	PCB mods QC
•	Programmed
•	Board level function check
•	Unit removed from shell
•	Potting removed from unit and checked for damage
•	Pictures of unit captured
•	PWR, GND, EFFECT and ANT wires soldered to PCB
•	PWR, GND, EFFECT and ANT wires soldering QC
•	PCB mounted in bracket and ANT wire routed
•	PWR, GND and EFFECT wires soldered to Unit
•	PWR, GND and EFFECT wires soldering QC
•	Integrated unit function check
•	AM150 potting poured and cured
•	SC-550 potting poured and cured
•	Integrated unit function check
•	Platform function check

For unit labelling what we would need to capture on the AVERY label is:
•	Unit SN
•	PCB SN
