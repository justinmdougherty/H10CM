# Production Management & Inventory Tracking App

Internal web application using React and TypeScript for production management and inventory tracking for a small team (~10 users). The application is styled using Material UI (MUI) and communicates with a Node.js/Express API backed by an MSSQL database.

This project was bootstrapped from the "Modernize - React and Next.js Admin Dashboard" template (Vite + TypeScript version, starterkit).

## Project Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/TF_CMapp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

3. **Configure API Proxy:**
    - Ensure the `server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts` is correctly pointing to your backend API.
        **Example:**

        ```typescript
        // vite.config.ts
        server: {
          proxy: {
            '/api': {
              target: '[http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/](http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/)', // Or your local backend
              changeOrigin: true,
              secure: false,
            },
          },
        },
        ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev    
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### üí° Future Enhancements & Bug Fixes

This section is for tracking new ideas, bugs, or improvements that come up during development.

- [x] **FIXED**:
    - [x] **S/N and Sorting**: `When new items are added, the item numbers are not based on that particular project, but all items added. MR had no items, I added 3 and rather than 1,2,3 it started at 5 and went to 7. also the items are not displayed in a lowest to highest sorting.`
    - [x] **S/N based on specific project**: `When adding new units, the starting s/n should be dynamic, and based on the project that is displayed. If the project has more than 1 item that has an S/N then is should offer a starting value for all items.`
    - [x] **Update steps completed**: `When the Step to update is applied, it does not update the batch tracking component or the information displayed in the modal.`
- [ ] **UI Polish:** Add loading spinners or skeletons to more areas for a smoother user experience.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Display more user-friendly error messages (e.g., using snackbars/toasts) when API calls fail, instead of just logging to the console.
- [ ] **Final Touches:**
  - [ ] **Code Cleanup:** Remove unused variables, console logs, and commented-out code.
  - [ ] **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for critical components and hooks.
  - [ ] **Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments to complex functions and components.

## Generic Batch Tracking System Architecture

### Overview

The batch tracking system has been designed as a highly configurable, reusable component that can support multiple project types with different workflows, steps, and requirements.

### Key Components

#### 1. **BatchTrackingComponent.tsx**

The main generic component that renders the batch tracking interface based on configuration.
- **Props:**
  - `projectId: string` - The ID of the project
  - `projectType: string` - Determines which configuration to load

#### 2. **PROJECT_TYPE_CONFIGS**

A configuration object that defines how each project type should behave.

```typescript
const PROJECT_TYPE_CONFIGS: Record<string, ProjectTypeConfig> = {
  PR: { /* PR-specific configuration */ },
  ASSEMBLY: { /* Assembly-specific configuration */ },
  // Easy to add more project types
}
```

#### 3. **Configuration Structure**
Each project type configuration includes:
* **Steps**: Array of production steps with order and descriptions.
* **Table Columns**: Dynamic column definitions with tab-specific visibility.
* **Unit Fields**: Form fields for creating new units.
* **Serial Number Prefixes**: Automatic S/N generation patterns.
