# Production Management & Inventory Tracking App

Internal web application using React and TypeScript for production management and inventory tracking for a small team (~10 users). The application is styled using Material UI (MUI) and communicates with an existing Node.js/Express API backed by an MSSQL database.

This project was bootstrapped from the "Modernize - React and Next.js Admin Dashboard" template (Vite + TypeScript version, starterkit).

## Project Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/TF_CMapp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3. **Configure API Proxy:**
    * Ensure the `server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts` is correctly pointing to your backend API.
        Example:

        ```typescript
        // vite.config.ts
        server: {
          proxy: {
            '/api': {
              target: '[http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/](http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/)', // Or your local backend
              changeOrigin: true,
              secure: false,
            },
          },
        },
        ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    # or
    # pnpm dev
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Generic Batch Tracking System Architecture

### Overview

The batch tracking system has been designed as a highly configurable, reusable component that can support multiple project types with different workflows, steps, and requirements.

### Key Components

#### 1. **BatchTrackingComponent.tsx**

The main generic component that renders the batch tracking interface based on configuration.

**Props:**
* `projectId: string` - The ID of the project
* `projectType: string` - Determines which configuration to load

#### 2. **PROJECT_TYPE_CONFIGS**

Configuration object that defines how each project type should behave:

```typescript
const PROJECT_TYPE_CONFIGS: Record<string, ProjectTypeConfig> = {
  PR: { /* PR-specific configuration */ },
  ASSEMBLY: { /* Assembly-specific configuration */ },
  // Easy to add more project types
}
```

#### 3. **Configuration Structure**

Each project type configuration includes:
* **Steps**: Array of production steps with order and descriptions
* **Table Columns**: Dynamic column definitions with tab-specific visibility
* **Unit Fields**: Form fields for creating new units
* **Serial Number Prefixes**: Automatic S/N generation patterns

### Highly Reusable Parts

‚úÖ **UI Structure:**
* Two-panel layout (units table + action panel)
* MUI Table structure for displaying units
* Checkbox selection logic (select all, individual selection)
* Tabs for "In Progress" / "Completed" / "Shipped" filtering
* "Add Units" modal with form inputs
* Step update panel with dropdowns and apply functionality

‚úÖ **State Management:**
* `selectedUnits` tracking
* `currentStepIdToUpdate` and `currentStatusToApply`
* `activeTab` management
* Modal visibility and form state
* Selection preservation during status updates

‚úÖ **Helper Functions:**
* `isUnitComplete()` - Determines if all steps are finished
* `getUnitLastCompletedStepInfo()` - Finds most recent completed step
* Unit detail modal with navigation capabilities

### Dynamic Parts (Configuration-Driven)

üîß **Project-Specific Steps:**
* Steps are now loaded from `config.steps` instead of hardcoded
* Each project type can have different numbers and types of steps
* Step names, descriptions, and order are fully configurable

üîß **Table Columns:**
* Columns are defined in configuration with tab-specific visibility
* Width, labels, and rendering logic can be customized per project type
* Support for conditional columns (e.g., PCB S/N only for certain projects)

üîß **Serial Number Generation:**
* Configurable prefixes per project type
* Support for different S/N patterns (Unit S/N, PCB S/N, etc.)
* Optional fields based on project requirements

üîß **Unit Data Structure:**
* Base structure is consistent across project types
* Additional custom fields supported via `[key: string]: any`
* Flexible enough to handle project-specific requirements

### Adding New Project Types

To add a new project type (e.g., "TESTING"):

1. **Add Configuration:**

```typescript
TESTING: {
  projectType: 'TESTING',
  displayName: 'Testing Project',
  steps: [
    { id: 'test_step_01', name: 'Initial calibration', order: 1 },
    { id: 'test_step_02', name: 'Performance test', order: 2 },
    // ... more steps
  ],
  tableColumns: [
    { id: 'unitSN', label: 'Test Unit S/N', width: '20%', tabs: ['inProgress', 'completed'] },
    // ... more columns
  ],
  unitFields: [
    { key: 'unitSN', label: 'Test Unit S/N', type: 'text', required: true },
  ],
  snPrefix: { unit: 'TEST-' },
}
```

2. **Update Supported Types:**

```typescript
const supportedBatchTypes = ['PR', 'ASSEMBLY', 'TESTING'];
```

3. **Database Integration:** Ensure your database schema supports the new project type and its specific requirements.

### Current Project Type Examples

#### **PR Project:**

- 17 detailed manufacturing steps
* Dual S/N tracking (Unit + PCB)
* Complex assembly workflow with potting and wiring steps

#### **Assembly Project:**

- 6 streamlined assembly steps
* Single S/N tracking
* Simplified workflow for basic assembly operations

Frontend Data Handling and Display Logic
Here's a conceptual overview of how your frontend application (e.g., using React, Vue, Angular, or similar) would typically handle the data fetched from the database to display a dynamic table for a selected project, like "PR".

This process uses the results from the queries we've discussed, particularly Query 3, Query 4, and Query 5 from the mssql_visualization_queries artifact.

Assumptions:

The user has selected a project (e.g., "PR"). The project_id for "PR" is known.

Your API/backend service can execute these SQL queries and return data, likely as JSON arrays of objects.

Step-by-Step Frontend Logic:

Fetch Column Definitions (Headers):

Action: The frontend makes an API call that executes a query similar to Query 3 (SELECT attribute_name, display_order, attribute_type, is_required FROM AttributeDefinitions WHERE project_id = @TargetProjectID ORDER BY display_order;).

Expected Data Format (JSON from API):

[
  { "attribute_name": "Unit S/N", "display_order": 1, "attribute_type": "TEXT", "is_required": true },
  { "attribute_name": "PCB S/N", "display_order": 2, "attribute_type": "TEXT", "is_required": true },
  { "attribute_name": "Firmware Version", "display_order": 3, "attribute_type": "TEXT", "is_required": false },
  { "attribute_name": "Calibration Date", "display_order": 4, "attribute_type": "DATE", "is_required": false }
]

Frontend Handling:

Store this array. This array defines the columns for your table: their names, order, data type (for potential formatting or input validation), and if they are mandatory.

Use this to render the table headers (<thead><tr><th>...</th></tr></thead>).

Fetch Tracked Items (Base Row Data):

Action: The frontend makes an API call that executes a query similar to Query 4 (SELECT item_id, current_overall_status, is_shipped, ... FROM TrackedItems WHERE project_id = @TargetProjectID;).

Expected Data Format (JSON from API):

[
  { "item_id": 1, "current_overall_status": "In Progress", "is_shipped": false, "item_notes": "Note for item 1" /*...other fixed fields */ },
  { "item_id": 2, "current_overall_status": "Pending", "is_shipped": false, "item_notes": null /* ... */ },
  { "item_id": 3, "current_overall_status": "Completed", "is_shipped": false, "item_notes": "Ready" /* ...*/ }
]

Frontend Handling:

Store this array. Each object represents a row in your table, containing the fixed information about each tracked unit.

Fetch All Attribute Values for these Items (EAV Data):

Action: The frontend makes an API call that executes a query similar to Query 5 (SELECT ti.item_id, ad.attribute_name, iav.attribute_value FROM TrackedItems ti JOIN ItemAttributeValues iav ... WHERE ti.project_id = @TargetProjectID;).

Expected Data Format (JSON from API - "unpivoted"):

[
  { "item_id": 1, "attribute_name": "Unit S/N", "attribute_value": "PR-U0001" },
  { "item_id": 1, "attribute_name": "PCB S/N", "attribute_value": "PR-P0001A" },
  { "item_id": 1, "attribute_name": "Firmware Version", "attribute_value": "v1.0.2" },
  { "item_id": 1, "attribute_name": "Calibration Date", "attribute_value": "2025-06-01" },
  { "item_id": 2, "attribute_name": "Unit S/N", "attribute_value": "PR-U0002" },
  { "item_id": 2, "attribute_name": "PCB S/N", "attribute_value": "PR-P0002B" },
  // Note: No Firmware or Cal Date for item_id 2 in this example data
  { "item_id": 3, "attribute_name": "Unit S/N", "attribute_value": "PR-U0003" },
  { "item_id": 3, "attribute_name": "PCB S/N", "attribute_value": "PR-P0003C" },
  { "item_id": 3, "attribute_name": "Firmware Version", "attribute_value": "v1.1.0" }
]

Transform/Merge Data for Display (Pivoting in Frontend Logic):

Action: This is where the frontend combines the data from steps 1, 2, and 3. For each TrackedItem from step 2, it needs to create a single object that includes its fixed fields and its dynamic attributes as key-value pairs.

Algorithm (Conceptual):

// fetchedColumnDefinitions from Step 1
// fetchedTrackedItems from Step 2
// fetchedAttributeValues (EAV data) from Step 3

const displayableTableData = fetchedTrackedItems.map(item => {
  // Start with the fixed fields of the item
  let rowData = { ...item }; // e.g., { item_id: 1, current_overall_status: "In Progress", ... }

  // Find all attribute values for the current item_id from the EAV data
  const itemSpecificAttributes = fetchedAttributeValues.filter(
    attrVal => attrVal.item_id === item.item_id
  );

  // Populate the dynamic columns
  // Use the attribute_name from fetchedColumnDefinitions as the key
  fetchedColumnDefinitions.forEach(colDef => {
    const attribute = itemSpecificAttributes.find(
      attr => attr.attribute_name === colDef.attribute_name
    );
    // Use the actual attribute_name as the key in the rowData object
    rowData[colDef.attribute_name] = attribute ? attribute.attribute_value : null; // Or undefined, or ""
  });

  return rowData;
});

/*
Example of what `displayableTableData` might look like for "PR":
[
  {
    "item_id": 1,
    "current_overall_status": "In Progress",
    "is_shipped": false,
    "item_notes": "Note for item 1",
    "Unit S/N": "PR-U0001",
    "PCB S/N": "PR-P0001A",
    "Firmware Version": "v1.0.2",
    "Calibration Date": "2025-06-01"
  },
  {
    "item_id": 2,
    "current_overall_status": "Pending",
    "is_shipped": false,
    "item_notes": null,
    "Unit S/N": "PR-U0002",
    "PCB S/N": "PR-P0002B",
    "Firmware Version": null, // Or undefined, because it wasn't in ItemAttributeValues
    "Calibration Date": null  // Or undefined
  },
  // ... other items
]
*/

Frontend Handling:

This displayableTableData array is now in a format that most table components can easily consume. Each object is a row, and the keys of the objects correspond to the column headers.

When rendering the table body (<tbody>), iterate through displayableTableData. For each item, iterate through fetchedColumnDefinitions (to maintain column order) and use item[colDef.attribute_name] to get the cell value.

Why this approach?

Flexibility: The frontend doesn't need to know the column names in advance. It discovers them from AttributeDefinitions (Query 3).

Efficiency: Query 5 (EAV data) can be large, but it's a structured way to get all dynamic data. The transformation (pivot) happens on the client-side.

Standard: This is a common pattern for handling EAV data in applications.

Alternative: SQL PIVOT (Query 5 - PIVOT example)

The PIVOT example in Query 5 shows how SQL could return the data already in a table-like structure.

Challenge: The FOR attribute_name IN ([Col1], [Col2], ...) part of the SQL PIVOT query needs to know the column names in advance. This means you'd have to dynamically construct this part of the SQL query on the backend, based on the results of Query 3. This can be complex and might lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled very carefully.

Benefit: If done on the backend, the frontend receives data already in the final table format, simplifying frontend logic.

Trade-off: More complex backend logic vs. more complex frontend transformation logic. For many web applications, performing the pivot in the frontend JavaScript is common and often more manageable.

This explanation should give you a clear picture of how the data flows from the database to a dynamically rendered table in your application.
