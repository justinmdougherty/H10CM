# Production Management & Inventory Tracking App

Internal web application using React and TypeScript for production management and inventory tracking for a small team (~10 users). The application is styled using Material UI (MUI) and communicates with an existing Node.js/Express API backed by an MSSQL database.

This project was bootstrapped from the "Modernize - React and Next.js Admin Dashboard" template (Vite + TypeScript version, starterkit).

## Project Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/TF_CMapp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3. **Configure API Proxy:**
    * Ensure the `server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts` is correctly pointing to your backend API.
        Example:

        ```typescript
        // vite.config.ts
        server: {
          proxy: {
            '/api': {
              target: '[http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/](http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/)', // Or your local backend
              changeOrigin: true,
              secure: false,
            },
          },
        },
        ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    # or
    # pnpm dev
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

  * [ ] **Calendar App:** Integrate from the full template.
* [ ] **State Management (Client-Side - Zustand):**
  * [ ] Install Zustand.
  * [ ] Create initial stores (e.g., for UI state, `authStore` for certificate user info).
  * [ ] Integrate `authStore` with `SidebarProfile/Profile.tsx`.

### To Do üìù

* **Core Features - UI Shells & TanStack Query Integration:**
  * [ ] **Inventory Page:**
    * [ ] Design layout (table/grid).
    * [ ] Create `src/types/inventory.ts` for `InventoryItem` interface.
    * [ ] Create `src/services/inventoryService.ts` (with mock data).
    * [ ] Create `src/hooks/useInventory.ts`.
    * [ ] Implement UI with TanStack Query for data fetching.
    * [ ] Create `AddInventoryItemForm.tsx` (static UI initially, then integrate with `useMutation`).
  * [ ] **Project Detail Page (Non-PR Projects):**
    * [ ] Define and display relevant details for non-PR projects if different from current generic display.
  * [ ] **Production Order Views:**
    * [ ] Design list & detail views.
    * [ ] Create types, services, and hooks for production orders.
    * [ ] Implement UI with TanStack Query.
    * [ ] Create forms (static UI then `useMutation`).
* **TanStack Query Mutations:**
  * [ ] Implement `useMutation` hooks for `add`, `update`, `delete` operations (projects, inventory, PR batch steps, adding units to batch).
  * [ ] Connect forms to these mutations.
  * [ ] Implement optimistic updates or query invalidation.
* **Real-Time Updates (for other users):**
  * [ ] Evaluate need: Start with TanStack Query's `refetchOnWindowFocus` and `refetchInterval`.
  * [ ] If more immediate updates are needed, plan for WebSockets/SSE.
* **API Service Layer:**
  * [ ] Update all `*Service.ts` files to make actual `fetch` calls to the backend API endpoints once they are defined and available.
* **Forms & Validation:**
  * [ ] Implement form validation robustly.
* **Styling Finalization:**
  * [ ] Get client feedback on the theme.
  * [ ] Ensure responsiveness.
* **Testing & Documentation.**
* **Local Dev Certificate Issue (Low Priority / Later).**

You're asking a very important architectural question! It's always good to think about reusability.

Regarding the reusability of PRBatchTrackingComponent.tsx:

Yes, a significant portion of it is highly reusable once you make the project-specific parts (primarily the steps) dynamic.

Here's a breakdown:

Highly Reusable Parts:

The overall UI structure:
Two-panel layout (units table on one side, action panel on the other).
The MUI Table structure for displaying units (Unit S/N, PCB S/N, Last Step, Date).
The checkbox selection logic for units (select all, select individual).
The Tabs for "In Progress" / "Completed" filtering.
The "Add Units" button and modal (the modal UI and basic quantity/SN inputs).
The general concept of an action panel with a dropdown for steps and a dropdown for statuses.
The "Apply to Selected" button logic.
The local state management for:
selectedUnits.
currentStepIdToUpdate.
currentStatusToApply.
activeTab.
Modal visibility and form state for adding units.
Helper functions like isUnitComplete (if the definition of "complete" is consistent) and getUnitLastCompletedStepInfo (though it would operate on the dynamic steps).
Parts That Need to Become Dynamic (Props or Fetched Data):

PR_PROJECT_STEPS: This is currently hardcoded. In a reusable component, this would need to be passed in as a prop, e.g., steps: ProductionStep[]. Your component would then use this steps prop to populate the "Step to Update" dropdown and for any logic that refers to step names or order.
initialMockPRBatch (and batchData state): The actual batch data (units, their current step statuses) would be fetched from your API based on a projectId and/or batchId passed as props. TanStack Query would handle this fetching. The component would then display the fetched data.
createInitialPRStepStatuses and createNewPRUnits: These functions currently use the hardcoded PR_PROJECT_STEPS. When steps is a prop, these functions would need to use that prop to initialize new units correctly for the specific project type's steps. The S/N generation in createNewPRUnits might also need to be more flexible or even server-driven.
TypeScript Interfaces (PRProductionStep, PRProductionUnit, etc.): If the core structure of a "unit" and its "step status" is the same across different project types (even if the actual steps are different), you could use more generic interface names (e.g., ProductionStep, UnitStepStatus, ProductionUnit). If different project types have vastly different data structures for their units or how steps are tracked, you might need different components or a more complex generic component with conditional rendering.
How to Make it Reusable:

Refactor PRBatchTrackingComponent.tsx into a more generic BatchTrackingComponent.tsx.
Props: This generic component would accept props like:
projectId: string
batchId: string
productionSteps: ProductionStep[] (This would be fetched by the parent page or a higher-level hook based on the project type/ID and then passed down).
initialBatchData?: ProductionBatch (Optional, if data is fetched by a parent).
Data Fetching: Inside BatchTrackingComponent.tsx (or a custom hook it uses), you'd use projectId and batchId with TanStack Query to fetch the specific batch data and potentially the productionSteps if they aren't passed as a prop.
Logic Adaptation: All internal logic that currently refers to PR_PROJECT_STEPS would be modified to use the productionSteps prop.
In summary: The core UI and interaction patterns you've built are very solid and reusable. The main change will be to decouple the hardcoded "PR" specific steps and data, making the component driven by props and fetched data. This way, you could use the same BatchTrackingComponent for "Midnight Rain" by simply passing it the "Midnight Rain" steps and batch data.
