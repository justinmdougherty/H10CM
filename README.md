This project was bootstrapped from the "Modernize - React and Next.js Admin Dashboard" template (Vite + TypeScript version, starterkit).

## Project Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/TF_CMapp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

3. **Configure API Proxy:**
    - Ensure the `server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts` is correctly pointing to your backend API.
        **Example:**

        ```typescript
        // vite.config.ts
        server: {
          proxy: {
            '/api': {
              target: '[http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/](http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/)', // Or your local backend
              changeOrigin: true,
              secure: false,
            },
          },
        },
        ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev    
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 💡 Legacy Future Enhancements & Bug Fixes

This section tracks previously identified improvements and fixes.

- [x] **FIXED**:
    - [x] **S/N and Sorting**: `When new items are added, the item numbers are not based on that particular project, but all items added. MR had no items, I added 3 and rather than 1,2,3 it started at 5 and went to 7. also the items are not displayed in a lowest to highest sorting.`
    - [x] **S/N based on specific project**: `When adding new units, the starting s/n should be dynamic, and based on the project that is displayed. If the project has more than 1 item that has an S/N then is should offer a starting value for all items.`
    - [x] **Update steps completed**: `When the Step to update is applied, it does not update the batch tracking component or the information displayed in the modal.`
- [ ] **UI Polish:** Add loading spinners or skeletons to more areas for a smoother user experience.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Display more user-friendly error messages (e.g., using snackbars/toasts) when API calls fail, instead of just logging to the console.
- [ ] **Final Touches:**
  - [ ] **Code Cleanup:** Remove unused variables, console logs, and commented-out code.
  - [ ] **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for critical components and hooks.
  - [ ] **Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments to complex functions and components.

## Project Status System & Dashboard Architecture

### Project Status Overview

The application features a redesigned project status system with dedicated dashboards for different user roles. The system separates concerns between production technicians (who need to focus on actionable work) and project managers (who need comprehensive portfolio oversight).

### Project Status Types

The system uses six distinct project statuses with clear hierarchical priorities:

1. **Active** - Production is currently ongoing (highest priority)
2. **Planning** - Project is being planned and prepared
3. **Completed** - All production has been completed successfully
4. **On Hold** - Production temporarily paused (requires attention)
5. **Inactive** - No current production planned
6. **Archived** - Project has been archived (lowest priority)

### Dashboard Architecture

#### 1. **Production Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)

**Target Users**: Production technicians and operators

**Purpose**: Focus on actionable work and current production status

**Features**:

- Shows only Active and On Hold projects (filtered for relevance)
- Clean, simplified interface optimized for production floor use
- Quick access to project details and batch tracking
- Removes management controls (project creation, status changes)
- Direct links to Project Management Dashboard for supervisors

#### 2. **Project Management Dashboard** (`/project-management`)

**Target Users**: Project managers, supervisors, and administrators

**Purpose**: Comprehensive project portfolio management and oversight

**Features**:

- Shows ALL projects regardless of status
- Advanced project management controls:
  - Create new projects
  - Change project statuses (with dropdown menu)
  - Comprehensive portfolio statistics
- **Smart Sorting**: Projects automatically sorted by status priority (Active → Planning → Completed → On Hold → Inactive → Archived)
- **Portfolio Overview Cards**:
  - Total projects count
  - Active projects count
  - Planning projects count  
  - Completed projects count
- Production statistics for each project (progress tracking, unit completion)
- Full project lifecycle management

### Status Management System

#### Status Configuration

Each status includes:

- **Color coding** for visual identification (success, info, warning, etc.)
- **Icons** for quick visual recognition
- **Descriptions** explaining the status meaning
- **Priority ordering** for automatic sorting

#### Status Change Workflow

- **Dropdown Menu**: Accessible via three-dot menu on project cards
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes immediately reflected across all dashboards
- **Success Feedback**: Visual confirmation when status changes are applied
- **User Permissions**: Status changes available only in management dashboard

### Navigation & Routing

#### Sidebar Navigation

- **Production Dashboard**: Primary link for technicians (`/dashboard`)
- **Project Management**: Management link for supervisors (`/project-management`)
- Clear role-based navigation structure

#### Route Structure

```typescript
Routes:
  /dashboard - Production Dashboard (ProjectsDashboardPage)
  /project-management - Project Management Dashboard (ProjectManagementDashboard)
  /project/:projectId - Project Detail Page (unchanged)
  /inventory - Inventory Management (unchanged)
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Components

- **`ProjectsDashboardPage.tsx`** - Production-focused dashboard with filtered view
- **`ProjectManagementDashboard.tsx`** - Management dashboard with full portfolio view
- **`AddProjectModal.tsx`** - Project creation modal (management dashboard only)
- **Status management** integrated into project cards with dropdown menus

#### Data Flow Implementation

1. **Projects Fetched** → `useGetProjects()` hook
2. **Smart Filtering** → Production dashboard shows Active/On Hold only
3. **Intelligent Sorting** → Projects sorted by status priority in both dashboards
4. **Real-time Updates** → React Query ensures data synchronization
5. **Status Changes** → `useUpdateProject()` mutation with immediate UI feedback

#### Status Type System

```typescript
type ProjectStatus = 'Active' | 'Inactive' | 'Planning' | 'Completed' | 'Archived' | 'On Hold';

const statusPriority: Record<ProjectStatus, number> = {
  Active: 1,
  Planning: 2, 
  Completed: 3,
  'On Hold': 4,
  Inactive: 5,
  Archived: 6,
};
```

### UI/UX Design Principles

#### Production Dashboard

- **Minimalist Design**: Reduces visual clutter for production environment
- **High Contrast**: Optimized for various lighting conditions
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons and cards for tablet/touch screen use
- **Dark Mode Compatible**: Consistent theming across light/dark modes

#### Management Dashboard

- **Information Dense**: Comprehensive overview for decision-making
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear status indicators and progress tracking
- **Professional Layout**: Cards with detailed statistics and management controls
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

- **Auto-status Suggestions**: Automatically suggest status changes based on production activity
- **Status Change Audit Trail**: Track who changed statuses and when
- **Role-based Permissions**: Fine-grained control over who can change project statuses
- **Status-based Notifications**: Alert users when projects need attention
- **Advanced Filtering**: Additional filters for managers (by date, team, etc.)
