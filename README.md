# Production Management & Inventory Tracking App

Internal web application using React and TypeScript for production management and inventory tracking for a small team (~10 users). The application is styled using Material UI (MUI) and communicates with an existing Node.js/Express API backed by an MSSQL database.

This project was bootstrapped from the "Modernize - React and Next.js Admin Dashboard" template (Vite + TypeScript version, starterkit).

## Project Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/TF_CMapp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3. **Configure API Proxy:**
    * Ensure the `server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts` is correctly pointing to your backend API.
        Example:

        ```typescript
        // vite.config.ts
        server: {
          proxy: {
            '/api': {
              target: '[http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/](http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/)', // Or your local backend
              changeOrigin: true,
              secure: false,
            },
          },
        },
        ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    # or
    # pnpm dev
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### In Progress üöß

* **Styling & Theming (Light Theme Contrast):**
  * [ ] Continue iterating on light theme colors to improve contrast between `background.default` and `background.paper` to ensure UI elements are clearly distinguishable.
* **Layout Adjustments for `PRBatchTrackingComponent`:**
  * [ ] Make the component wider to utilize more screen space effectively if still needed.
* **App Integration (from Full Template):**
  * [ ] **Tickets App:** Continue resolving any remaining dependencies or issues. Verify full functionality.
  * [ ] **Notes App:** Integrate from the full template. (Consider how batch-level notes from `PRBatchTrackingComponent` will integrate here).
  * [ ] **Calendar App:** Integrate from the full template. (Plan to display batch start/target completion dates).
* **State Management (Client-Side - Zustand):**
  * [ ] Install Zustand.
  * [ ] Create initial stores (e.g., for UI state, `authStore` for certificate user info).
  * [ ] Integrate `authStore` with `SidebarProfile/Profile.tsx` (if not fully covered by `certificateService` for display).

### To Do üìù

* **Database Design & Backend Integration for Dynamic Projects & Inventory:**
  * [ ] **Design and Implement Core Tables (MSSQL):**
    * [ ] `Projects`: To store project master data (ProjectID PK, ProjectName, etc.).
    * [ ] `StepDefinitions`: To store user-definable steps for each project (StepDefinitionID PK, ProjectID FK, StepName, StepOrder).
    * [ ] `InventoryItems`: Master list of all inventory parts (InventoryItemID PK, ItemName, CurrentStock, UnitOfMeasure, PartNumber).
    * [ ] `StepInventoryConsumption`: Links steps to inventory items they consume (ConsumptionID PK, StepDefinitionID FK, InventoryItemID FK, QuantityConsumed).
    * [ ] `ProductionBatches`: Tracks batches of units (ProductionBatchID PK, ProjectID FK, BatchName, BatchStartDate, BatchTargetCompletionDate, BatchNotes).
    * [ ] `BatchUnits`: Individual units within a batch (BatchUnitID PK, ProductionBatchID FK, UnitSerialNumber, PCBSerialNumber, IsShipped, ShippedDate, DateFullyCompleted).
    * [ ] `UnitStepProgress`: Tracks status of each step for each unit (UnitStepProgressID PK, BatchUnitID FK, StepDefinitionID FK, Status, CompletedDate, CompletedByUserID).
  * [ ] **Develop API Endpoints:** Create Node.js/Express API endpoints for CRUD operations on these new tables.
  * [ ] **Refactor Frontend Services (`*Service.ts` files):** Update to make actual `fetch` calls to the new backend API endpoints.
  * [ ] **Refactor `PRBatchTrackingComponent` (and generalize it):**
    * [ ] Fetch project-specific steps based on `ProjectID`.
    * [ ] Fetch and update batch data, unit data, and step progress via API calls.
    * [ ] Implement logic for automatic inventory decrementation on step completion (backend process triggered by frontend action).
* **Core Features - UI Shells & TanStack Query Integration (continued):**
  * [ ] **User Interface for Project & Step Management:**
    * [ ] UI for users to create/edit projects.
    * [ ] UI for users to define/edit steps for each project, including their order.
    * [ ] UI for users to associate inventory items and consumption quantities with specific steps.
  * [ ] **Inventory Page (Full Implementation):**
    * [ ] Design layout (table/grid) for `InventoryItems`.
    * [ ] Create `src/types/inventory.ts` for `InventoryItem` interface (if not already covered by backend types).
    * [ ] Create `src/services/inventoryService.ts` and `src/hooks/useInventory.ts` (for API calls).
    * [ ] Implement UI with TanStack Query for data fetching, display, and updates.
    * [ ] Create `AddInventoryItemForm.tsx` (integrate with `useMutation`).
    * [ ] Implement inventory adjustment features.
  * [ ] **Production Order Views (Full Implementation):**
    * [ ] Design list & detail views for `ProductionBatches`.
    * [ ] Create types, services, and hooks for production orders/batches.
    * [ ] Implement UI with TanStack Query.
    * [ ] Create forms for creating/editing batches (integrate with `useMutation`).
* **TanStack Query Mutations:**
  * [ ] Implement `useMutation` hooks for all `add`, `update`, `delete` operations (projects, inventory, batch steps, adding units to batch, etc.).
  * [ ] Connect forms to these mutations.
  * [ ] Implement optimistic updates or query invalidation strategies.
* **Batch Notes Integration:**
  * [ ] Design UI for viewing/editing batch-level notes (e.g., in `PRBatchTrackingComponent` or linked `Notes` app component).
  * [ ] Ensure `ProductionBatches` table and API support saving/retrieving these notes.
* **Calendar Integration:**
  * [ ] Display `BatchStartDate` and `BatchTargetCompletionDate` from `ProductionBatches` on the Calendar app.
* **Real-Time Updates (for other users):**
  * [ ] Evaluate need: Start with TanStack Query's `refetchOnWindowFocus` and `refetchInterval`.
  * [ ] If more immediate updates are needed, plan for WebSockets/SSE for changes in batch/step status.
* **Forms & Validation:**
  * [ ] Implement robust form validation across all input forms.
* **Styling Finalization & Responsiveness:**
  * [ ] Get client feedback on the theme.
  * [ ] Ensure responsiveness across devices.
* **Testing & Documentation.**
* **Configuration Management (Further Considerations):**
  * [ ] **Database Schema Management/Migrations:** Implement a tool/strategy (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, or custom scripts) for managing database schema changes across environments.
  * [ ] **API Versioning Strategy:** Plan if/how the API will be versioned as it evolves.
  * [ ] **Environment Configuration:** Ensure a robust way to manage different configurations (API URLs, database connections) for dev, test, and production environments (e.g., using `.env` files).
  * [ ] **Build and Deployment Automation:** Set up CI/CD pipelines.
  * [ ] **Comprehensive CM Documentation:** Document all CM processes and configurations.
* **Local Dev Certificate Issue (Low Priority / Later).**


Reusability of PRBatchTrackingComponent.tsx for other projects:

Highly Reusable Parts:

The overall UI structure:
Two-panel layout (units table on one side, action panel on the other).
The MUI Table structure for displaying units (Unit S/N, PCB S/N, Last Step, Date).
The checkbox selection logic for units (select all, select individual).
The Tabs for "In Progress" / "Completed" filtering.
The "Add Units" button and modal (the modal UI and basic quantity/SN inputs).
The general concept of an action panel with a dropdown for steps and a dropdown for statuses.
The "Apply to Selected" button logic.
The local state management for:
selectedUnits.
currentStepIdToUpdate.
currentStatusToApply.
activeTab.
Modal visibility and form state for adding units.
Helper functions like isUnitComplete (if the definition of "complete" is consistent) and getUnitLastCompletedStepInfo (though it would operate on the dynamic steps).
Parts That Need to Become Dynamic (Props or Fetched Data):

PR_PROJECT_STEPS: This is currently hardcoded. In a reusable component, this would need to be passed in as a prop, e.g., steps: ProductionStep[]. Your component would then use this steps prop to populate the "Step to Update" dropdown and for any logic that refers to step names or order.
initialMockPRBatch (and batchData state): The actual batch data (units, their current step statuses) would be fetched from your API based on a projectId and/or batchId passed as props. TanStack Query would handle this fetching. The component would then display the fetched data.
createInitialPRStepStatuses and createNewPRUnits: These functions currently use the hardcoded PR_PROJECT_STEPS. When steps is a prop, these functions would need to use that prop to initialize new units correctly for the specific project type's steps. The S/N generation in createNewPRUnits might also need to be more flexible or even server-driven.
TypeScript Interfaces (PRProductionStep, PRProductionUnit, etc.): If the core structure of a "unit" and its "step status" is the same across different project types (even if the actual steps are different), you could use more generic interface names (e.g., ProductionStep, UnitStepStatus, ProductionUnit). If different project types have vastly different data structures for their units or how steps are tracked, you might need different components or a more complex generic component with conditional rendering.
How to Make it Reusable:

Refactor PRBatchTrackingComponent.tsx into a more generic BatchTrackingComponent.tsx.
Props: This generic component would accept props like:
projectId: string
batchId: string
productionSteps: ProductionStep[] (This would be fetched by the parent page or a higher-level hook based on the project type/ID and then passed down).
initialBatchData?: ProductionBatch (Optional, if data is fetched by a parent).
Data Fetching: Inside BatchTrackingComponent.tsx (or a custom hook it uses), you'd use projectId and batchId with TanStack Query to fetch the specific batch data and potentially the productionSteps if they aren't passed as a prop.
Logic Adaptation: All internal logic that currently refers to PR_PROJECT_STEPS would be modified to use the productionSteps prop.
In summary: The core UI and interaction patterns you've built are very solid and reusable. The main change will be to decouple the hardcoded "PR" specific steps and data, making the component driven by props and fetched data. This way, you could use the same BatchTrackingComponent for "Midnight Rain" by simply passing it the "Midnight Rain" steps and batch data.
