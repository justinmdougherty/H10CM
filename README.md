# Production Management & Inventory Tracking App

Internal web application using React and TypeScript for production management and inventory tracking for a small team (~10 users). The application is styled using Material UI (MUI) and communicates with a Node.js/Express API backed by an MSSQL database.

This project was bootstrapped from the "Modernize - React and Next.js Admin Dashboard" template (Vite + TypeScript version, starterkit).

## Project Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/TF_CMapp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

3. **Configure API Proxy:**
    - Ensure the `server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts` is correctly pointing to your backend API.
        **Example:**

        ```typescript
        // vite.config.ts
        server: {
          proxy: {
            '/api': {
              target: '[http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/](http://h10-websvr01.rdte.nswc.navy.mil:3000/)', // Or your local backend
              changeOrigin: true,
              secure: false,
            },
          },
        },
        ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev    
    ```

    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

  - [ ] **Code Cleanup:** Remove unused variables, console logs, and commented-out code.
  - [ ] **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for critical components and hooks.
  - [ ] **Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments to complex functions and components.

## Generic Batch Tracking System Architecture

### Overview

The batch tracking system has been designed as a highly configurable, reusable component that can support multiple project types with different workflows, steps, and requirements.

### Key Components

#### 1. **BatchTrackingComponent.tsx**

The main generic component that renders the batch tracking interface based on configuration.

  - `projectId: string` - The ID of the project
  - `projectType: string` - Determines which configuration to load

#### 2. **PROJECT_TYPE_CONFIGS**

A configuration object that defines how each project type should behave.

```typescript
const PROJECT_TYPE_CONFIGS: Record<string, ProjectTypeConfig> = {
  PR: { /* PR-specific configuration */ },
  ASSEMBLY: { /* Assembly-specific configuration */ },
  // Easy to add more project types
}
```

#### 3. **Configuration Structure**
Each project type configuration includes:
* **Steps**: Array of production steps with order and descriptions.
* **Table Columns**: Dynamic column definitions with tab-specific visibility.
* **Unit Fields**: Form fields for creating new units.
* **Serial Number Prefixes**: Automatic S/N generation patterns.

# TF_CMapp Application Structure Breakdown

This document provides an overview of the `TF_CMapp` React frontend application's structure, highlighting key components and their dependencies.

## 1. Core Application Flow

The application's entry point and core setup are managed by the following files:

- **`src/main.tsx`**:
  - **Purpose**: The main entry point of the React application. It renders the root component (`App`).
  - **Key Responsibilities**:
    - Initializes React Query (`QueryClientProvider`) for global data fetching and caching.
    - Sets up `CustomizerContextProvider` for theme and layout customization.
    - Includes a `Suspense` fallback for lazy-loaded components, displaying a `Spinner`.
  - **Dependencies**: `App.tsx`, `views/spinner/Spinner.tsx`, `utils/i18n.ts`, `context/CustomizerContext.tsx`, `react-query`.

- **`src/App.tsx`**:
  - **Purpose**: The main application component that sets up the global theme and routing.
  - **Key Responsibilities**:
    - Applies the Material UI theme using `ThemeProvider`.
    - Manages Right-to-Left (RTL) direction with `RTL` component.
    - Integrates React Router for navigation using `RouterProvider`.
  - **Dependencies**: `context/CustomizerContext.tsx`, `theme/Theme.tsx`, `layouts/full/shared/customizer/RTL.tsx`, `routes/Router.tsx`, `@mui/material`.

- **`src/routes/Router.tsx`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines the application's routing structure using `react-router-dom`.
  - **Key Responsibilities**:
    - Configures routes for different pages and layouts.
    - Uses `Loadable` for lazy loading components, improving initial load performance.
    - Defines main layouts (`FullLayout`, `BlankLayout`) and their nested routes.
  - **Key Routes**:
    - `/`: Redirects to `/dashboard`.
    - `/dashboard`: Renders `ProjectsDashboardPage`.
    - `/project/:projectId`: Renders `ProjectDetailPage` for specific project details.
    - `/inventory`: Renders `InventoryPage`.
    - `/apps/notes`: Renders `NotesPage`.
    - `/apps/calendar`: Renders `CalendarPage`.
    - `/apps/tickets`: Renders `TicketsPage`.

- **`src/views/project-detail/BatchTrackingComponent.tsx`**:
  - **Purpose**: Manages and displays "tracked items" (batches) associated with a project.
  - **Key Responsibilities**:
    - Fetches batch data using React Query (`useQuery`).
    - Manages local state for selected units, step updates, and modal visibility.
    - Provides UI for updating step statuses and marking units as shipped using React Query mutations (`useMutation`).
    - Handles adding new units to a batch.
    - Displays unit details in a modal.
    - Integrates with `certificateService` to get current user information.

  - **Dependencies**: Expected to use `hooks/api/useInventoryHooks.ts` for data fetching.

## 3. Data Fetching and Services

- **`src/hooks/api/useProjectHooks.ts` (Planned)**:
  - **Purpose**: To encapsulate API calls related to projects using React Query custom hooks.
  - **Key Responsibilities**: Provide hooks like `useProjects` (for fetching all projects) and `useProjectDetails` (for fetching a single project).
  - **Dependencies**: `axios`, `react-query`, `services/api.ts`, `types/Project.ts`.

- **`src/hooks/api/useInventoryHooks.ts` (Planned)**:
  - **Purpose**: To encapsulate API calls related to inventory using React Query custom hooks.

  - **Dependencies**: `axios`, `react-query`, `services/api.ts`, `types/Inventory.ts`.

- **`src/services/api.ts`**:
  - **Purpose**: Centralized Axios instance for making API requests to the backend.
  - **Key Responsibilities**: Configures the base URL for API calls.
  - **Dependencies**: `axios`.

- **`src/services/certificateService.ts`**:
  - **Purpose**: Handles fetching current user information, likely for authentication or display purposes.
  - **Key Responsibilities**: Provides a `getCurrentUser` function.
  - **Dependencies**: `axios`.

## 4. Type Definitions

- **`src/types/Project.ts`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for project-related data structures.
  - **Key Responsibilities**: Ensures type safety and consistency across the application when dealing with project objects.

- **`src/types/Inventory.ts`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for inventory-related data structures.
  - **Key Responsibilities**: Ensures type safety and consistency for inventory items.

## 5. Styling and Theming

- **`src/theme/Theme.tsx`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines the Material UI theme for the application.
  - **Key Responsibilities**: Configures colors, typography, components, and shadows.
  - **Dependencies**: `@mui/material`, `DarkThemeColors.tsx`, `DefaultColors.tsx`, `LightThemeColors.tsx`, `Shadows.tsx`, `ThemeColors.tsx`, `Typography.tsx`, `Components.tsx`.

## 6. State Management

- **Zustand**: While not explicitly detailed in the current file analysis, the `GEMINI.md` indicates Zustand is used for global state management (e.g., user authentication, notifications). This would typically involve a store definition in `src/store/` (e.g., `src/store/userStore.ts`).

## 7. Utilities

- **`src/utils/i18n.ts`**:
  - **Purpose**: Configures internationalization (i18n) for the application.
  - **Dependencies**: `i18next`, `react-i18next`.
