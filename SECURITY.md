## Reporting a Vulnerability

**We take security seriously.** If you discover a security vulnerability in H10CM, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainer at `justinmdougherty@example.com`
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/justinmdougherty/H10CM/security/advisories/new)
3. **Encrypted Communication**: For highly sensitive issues, request PGP key for encrypted communication

### What to Include

Please provide the following information in your report:

- **Vulnerability Description**: Clear description of the security issue
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Proof of Concept**: Code snippets, screenshots, or demonstration (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report submission
- **Triage**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### Severity Classification

We classify vulnerabilities using the following criteria:

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data breach
- **High**: Authentication bypass, significant data exposure
- **Medium**: Cross-site scripting, information disclosure
- **Low**: Minor information leaks, low-impact vulnerabilities

### Security Best Practices for H10CM

#### Multi-Tenant Security
- All API endpoints enforce program-level filtering
- Database procedures validate program access
- User permissions are checked at multiple layers

#### Authentication
- Certificate-based authentication in production
- Development mode uses fallback authentication
- Session management follows OWASP guidelines

#### Database Security
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Stored procedures use JSON parameters
- Database access is restricted by program context

#### Deployment Security
- Regular dependency scanning via Trivy
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Environment-specific configuration management

## Security Features

### Implemented Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and stored procedures
- **Authentication**: Certificate-based user verification
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Complete data separation by program
- **Audit Logging**: User actions and access patterns are logged
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

### Ongoing Security Monitoring

- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Code review process for all changes
- Security-focused CI/CD pipeline

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to:

1. Verify and reproduce reported vulnerabilities
2. Develop appropriate fixes
3. Coordinate disclosure timelines
4. Acknowledge contributors (with permission)
