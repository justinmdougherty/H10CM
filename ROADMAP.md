### 🏗️ Architecture Status

#### ✅ Working Components
- **Multi-Tenant Database**: MSSQL with program-level isolation
- **Authentication**: Certificate-based auth with RBAC
- **Backend API**: Node.js + Express with JSON stored procedures
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Material UI
- **Inventory Management**: CRUD operations working
- **Shopping Cart**: Order creation and management

#### 🔧 Components Needing Attention
- **Error Handling**: Needs improvement across all layers
- **Testing**: Low coverage, needs comprehensive test suite
- **Documentation**: API docs and user guides needed
- **Performance**: Database query optimization needed
- **Security**: Complete audit required

### 📊 Technical Debt

#### High Priority
- [ ] **API Consistency** - Standardize response formats across all endpoints
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Implement consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] **Database Optimization** - Review and optimize stored procedures
- [ ] **Security Review** - Complete security audit of all endpoints

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Code Documentation** - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring** - Implement APM and logging
- [ ] **UI Consistency** - Standardize component patterns
- [ ] **Database Migrations** - Create proper migration system

### 🔍 Known Issues

#### Critical
- None currently identified

#### High
- [ ] Need to complete multi-tenant security audit
- [ ] Error handling inconsistencies across components

#### Medium
- [ ] UI loading states need improvement
- [ ] Database query performance optimization needed
- [ ] API documentation is incomplete

### 📈 Key Metrics

- **Backend API Endpoints**: ~20 implemented
- **Frontend Components**: ~50+ components
- **Database Tables**: 15+ with multi-tenant architecture
- **Test Coverage**: Low (needs improvement)
- **Performance**: Good for current load
- **Security**: Basic multi-tenant isolation implemented

### 🛠️ Development Tools & Workflow

#### Current Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Material UI, React Query
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MSSQL, Certificate Auth
- **Database**: SQL Server 2022 with stored procedures
- **Development**: VS Code, GitHub, PowerShell

#### Recommended Next Steps
1. Set up GitHub Projects for better task management
2. Create comprehensive issue templates (✅ Done)
3. Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
4. Set up automated testing workflow
5. Create development documentation wiki
