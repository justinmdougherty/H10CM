# GitHub Project Management Setup Guide

## Quick Start: Creating Initial Issues

### 1. High Priority Issues to Create

Copy and paste these into new GitHub issues:

#### Issue #1: Multi-Tenant Security Audit
```
Title: [TASK] Complete Multi-Tenant Security Audit for All API Endpoints

Labels: security, task, high-priority, backend

Description:
Conduct a comprehensive security audit to ensure all API endpoints properly filter data by program_id for multi-tenant isolation.

**Context:**
While fixing the inventory display issue, we discovered that the inventory endpoint was missing program_id filtering. We need to audit all endpoints to prevent data leakage between tenants.

**Scope:**
- [ ] Audit all GET endpoints for proper program filtering
- [ ] Audit all POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints for program validation
- [ ] Review middleware implementation
- [ ] Test cross-tenant data access scenarios
- [ ] Document security patterns

**Endpoints to Review:**
- [ ] /api/projects
- [ ] /api/tasks  
- [ ] /api/inventory-items
- [ ] /api/orders
- [ ] /api/cart
- [ ] All other data endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All endpoints verified to have program_id filtering
- [ ] Security test cases written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated with security patterns
- [ ] No cross-tenant data access possible

**Priority:** High - Security critical
```

#### Issue #2: API Response Standardization
```
Title: [TASK] Standardize API Response Formats Across All Endpoints

Labels: backend, api, consistency, medium-priority

Description:
Standardize response formats across all API endpoints to improve frontend development experience and error handling.

**Problem:**
Different endpoints return data in different formats:
- Some return arrays directly
- Some return { data: array }
- Error handling is inconsistent

**Solution:**
Create standard response format:
```typescript
// Success responses
{ success: true, data: any, message?: string }

// Error responses  
{ success: false, error: string, details?: any }
```

**Files to Modify:**
- [ ] `api/index.js` - Update all endpoint responses
- [ ] `H10CM/src/services/api.ts` - Update API client
- [ ] All React hooks in `src/hooks/api/`

**Priority:** Medium - Developer experience improvement
```

#### Issue #3: Comprehensive Testing Implementation
```
Title: [TASK] Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite

Labels: testing, quality, high-priority

Description:
Implement comprehensive testing coverage for both frontend and backend to prevent regressions like the inventory display bug.

**Current State:**
- Backend: Basic Jest setup, low coverage
- Frontend: Basic Vitest setup, low coverage

**Goals:**
- Backend: 80%+ test coverage
- Frontend: 70%+ test coverage
- Integration tests for critical flows

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Backend API endpoint tests
- [ ] Database/stored procedure tests
- [ ] Frontend component tests
- [ ] React hook tests
- [ ] Integration tests for key workflows
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

**Priority:** High - Prevent future regressions
```

### 2. Setting Up GitHub Projects

1. **Go to your repository** → Projects → New Project
2. **Create project**: "H10CM Development Board"
3. **Add views**:
   - **Backlog**: All open issues
   - **Sprint**: Current iteration items
   - **In Progress**: Actively being worked
   - **Review**: Pending review/testing
   - **Done**: Completed items

4. **Add fields**:
   - Priority (High/Medium/Low)
   - Component (Frontend/Backend/Database/etc.)
   - Effort (Small/Medium/Large/XL)
   - Sprint (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, etc.)

### 3. Recommended Labels

Create these labels in your repository:

#### Type Labels
- `bug` - Software defects
- `feature` - New functionality  
- `task` - Development work
- `documentation` - Docs improvements
- `security` - Security related

#### Priority Labels
- `critical` - Blocking/urgent
- `high-priority` - Important
- `medium-priority` - Moderate importance
- `low-priority` - Nice to have

#### Component Labels
- `frontend` - React/TypeScript
- `backend` - Node.js/Express
- `database` - SQL/stored procedures
- `api` - API endpoints
- `ui` - User interface
- `authentication` - Auth/RBAC
- `inventory` - Inventory features
- `multi-tenant` - Multi-tenancy

#### Status Labels
- `needs-triage` - New, needs review
- `ready` - Ready to start
- `in-progress` - Being worked on
- `needs-review` - Pending review
- `blocked` - Cannot proceed

### 4. Milestone Suggestions

Create these milestones:

1. **v1.1 - Security & Stability** (Target: August 2025)
   - Multi-tenant security audit
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Error handling improvements
   - Performance optimization

2. **v1.2 - Feature Enhancements** (Target: September 2025)
   - Advanced inventory features
   - Improved UI/UX
   - Enhanced reporting
   - Mobile responsiveness

3. **v2.0 - Advanced Features** (Target: Q4 2025)
   - Real-time notifications
   - Advanced analytics
   - External integrations
   - Advanced permissions

### 5. Daily Workflow

1. **Check Project Board** - Review current sprint items
2. **Update Issue Status** - Move cards as work progresses
3. **Create Issues** - Document new bugs/features as discovered
4. **Review & Triage** - Weekly review of new issues
5. **Sprint Planning** - Bi-weekly sprint planning sessions

### 6. Automation Ideas

Set up GitHub Actions for:
- **Auto-labeling** based on file paths changed
- **Auto-assignment** based on component area
- **Status updates** when PRs are created/merged
- **Testing** on every pull request
- **Deploy** on successful merges to main

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create the initial high-priority issues above
2. ✅ Set up the project board with recommended views
3. ✅ Add the recommended labels
4. ✅ Create initial milestones
5. ✅ Start using the workflow for daily development

This will give you much better visibility into development progress and help track technical debt and feature requests systematically!
